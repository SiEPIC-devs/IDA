VISA DATA TYPES
The driver functions use VISA data types. VISA data types are identified by the ‘Vi’ prefix in the data type name (e.g. ViInt16, ViUInt16, ViChar). The visatype.h file contains a complete listing of the VISA data types, function call casts and some of the common constants. The following is a partial list of the type definitions and constant definitions in visatype.h.

Completion and Error Codes

VI_SUCCESS A long equal to zero

VI_ERROR A long equal to hex 0x80000000

Other VISA Definitions

The size of the following three symbols is operating system dependent and is equal to the default integer size.

VI_NULL An integer equal to 0

VI_TRUE An integer equal to 1

VI_FALSE An integer equal to 0
